# STAT3340-final-project
My final project for my STAT3340 course. In which I will be performing a linear regression on this vehicles dataset

Abstract:
It is strongly suggested that the selling price of a vehicle tends to be determined through certain factors
of the vehicle. This study investigates the relationship between the selling price of the vehicles and other
factors such as the year it was sold, the number of kilometers driven, the fuel type, transmission, and number
of previous owners. Specifically, it hopes to identify which of these factors have the biggest impact on the
selling price. To do so, a detailed list of 4340 vehicles was made and along with this included the factors
mentioned above of these vehicles to determined if our hypothesis that there is a strong relationship. Our
analysis shows a strong correlation between the selling price of vehicles and these other factors. The results
show that although there is a relationship between the selling price and other factors it is not as strong as
we expected.
